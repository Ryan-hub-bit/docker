# docker

## the advantage of docker compared to traditional VM
Each individual machine or VM need to install OS, Upgrade and patch(补丁) it. Install dependencies for the application that will run on this instance.

## Solution - Docker to the rescue
*build image:consistently package everything your application needs to run
*ship image:ship these images to runtimes in the cloud or on your local developer machine.
*run image: execute your applications 

## docker command
